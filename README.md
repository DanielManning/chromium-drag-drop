# chromium-drag-drop

Demo: https://danielmanning.github.io/chromium-drag-drop/

A draggable box is rendered when click-dragging over the paragraph content.

On a Mac, the box does not get dragged the first time when rendered underneath the mouse.
The draggable div is only dragged when the user drags and lets go within the draggable div
boundary, then drags the box again.
